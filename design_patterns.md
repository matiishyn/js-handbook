## Anti-Pattern
is a bad design that is worthy of documenting

## Categories Of Design Pattern
#### Creational Design Patterns
focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. 
Patterns: Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton and Builder.

#### Structural Design Patterns
are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. Patterns: Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter and Proxy

#### Behavioral Design Patterns
focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system. Patterns: Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor.

## Patterns

Pattern | Description  
---|---
**Creational** | Based on the concept of creating an object.
***Class*** | 
Factory Method | This makes an instance of several derived classes based on interfaced data or events.
***Object*** | 
Abstract Factory | Creates an instance of several families of classes without detailing concrete classes.
Builder | Separates object construction from its representation, always creates the same type of object.
Prototype | A fully initialized instance used for copying or cloning.
Singleton | A class with only a single instance with global access points.
- | -
**Structural** | Based on the idea of building blocks of objects.
***Class*** | 
Adapter | Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces.
***Object*** | 
Adapter | Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces.
Bridge | Separates an object's interface from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
Composite | A structure of simple and composite objects which makes the total object more than just the sum of its parts.
Decorator | Dynamically add alternate processing to objects.
Facade | A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem.
Flyweight | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of information that is contained elsewhere.
Proxy | A place holder object representing the true object.
-|-
**Behavioral**|Based on the way objects play and work together.
***Class*** | 
Interpreter|A way to include language elements in an application to match the grammar of the intended language.
Template Method|Creates the shell of an algorithm in a method, then defer the exact steps to a subclass.
***Object*** | 
Chain of Responsibility|A way of passing a request between a chain of objects to find the object that can handle the request.
Command|Encapsulate a command request as an object to enable, logging and/or queuing of requests, and provides error-handling for unhandled requests.
Iterator | Sequentially access the elements of a collection without knowing the inner workings of the collection.
Mediator | Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.
Memento| Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.
Observer| A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes.
State| Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
Strategy| Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class separating the selection from the implementation.
Visitor|Adds a new operation to a class without changing the class.


## The Constructor Pattern
```js
function Car( model, year, miles ) {
  this.model = model;
}
  
// Note here that we are using Object.prototype.newMethod rather than
// Object.prototype so as to avoid redefining the prototype object
Car.prototype.toString = function () {
  return "Model is: " + this.model;
};
 
// Usage:
var civic = new Car("Honda Civic");
```

## The Module Pattern
### Modules
* The Module pattern
* Object literal notation
* AMD modules
* CommonJS modules
* ES6 modules

### Object Literals
```js
var myModule = {
  myConfig: {
    useCaching: true,
    language: "en"
  },
 
  saySomething: function () {
    console.log( "Where in the world is Paul Irish today?" );
  }
};

// usage
myModule.saySomething();
```

### The Module Pattern
```js
var testModule = (function () { 
  var private = 0;
  function privateMethod() {/* ... */}
  return {
    public: function () {
      return counter++;
    }
  };
})();
 
// Usage:
testModule.public();
```

## The Singleton Pattern
```js
var mySingleton = (function () {
  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;
 
  function init() {
    // Private methods and variables
    function privateMethod(){
        console.log( "I am private" );
    }
    return {
      // Public methods and variables
      publicMethod: function () {
        console.log( "The public can see me!" );
      },
      publicProperty: "I am also public"
 
    };
  };
 
  return {
    // Get the Singleton instance if one exists
    // or create one if it doesn't
    getInstance: function () {
      if ( !instance ) {
        instance = init();
      }
      return instance;
    }
  };
})();
 
// Usage:
var singleA = mySingleton.getInstance();
var singleB = mySingleton.getInstance();
console.log( singleA.getRandomNumber() === singleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true
```

## The Observer Pattern. [Ref](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#observerpatternjavascript)
The Observer is a design pattern where an object (known as a subject) maintains a list of objects depending on it (observers), automatically notifying them of any changes to state.

When a subject needs to notify observers about something interesting happening, it broadcasts a notification to the observers (which can include specific data related to the topic of the notification).

When we no longer wish for a particular observer to be notified of changes by the subject they are registered with, the subject can remove them from the list of observers.

#### Differences Between The Observer And Publish/Subscribe Pattern
The Observer pattern requires that the observer (or object) wishing to receive topic notifications must subscribe this interest to the object firing the event (the subject).

The Publish/Subscribe pattern however uses a topic/event channel which sits between the objects wishing to receive notifications (subscribers) and the object firing the event (the publisher). This event system allows code to define application specific events which can pass custom arguments containing values needed by the subscriber. The idea here is to avoid dependencies between the subscriber and publisher.

This differs from the Observer pattern as it allows any subscriber implementing an appropriate event handler to register for and receive topic notifications broadcast by the publisher.
```js
// Publish
// jQuery: $(obj).trigger("channel", [arg1, arg2, arg3]);
$( el ).trigger( "/login", [{username:"test", userData:"test"}] );
 
// Subscribe
// jQuery: $(obj).on( "channel", [data], fn );
$( el ).on( "/login", function( event ){...} );
 
// Unsubscribe
// jQuery: $(obj).off( "channel" );
$( el ).off( "/login" );
```

## The Mediator Pattern
A real-world analogy could be a typical airport traffic control system. A tower (Mediator) handles what planes can take off and land because all communications (notifications being listened out for or broadcast) are done from the planes to the control tower, rather than from plane-to-plane. A centralized controller is key to the success of this system and that's really the role a Mediator plays in software design.

A Mediator is an object that coordinates interactions (logic and behavior) between multiple objects. It makes decisions on when to call which objects, based on the actions (or inaction) of other objects and input.

##### Events
Both the event aggregator and mediator use events, in the above examples. 

#### Mediator Vs. Facade

The Mediator centralizes communication between modules where it's explicitly referenced by these modules. In a sense this is multidirectional. The Facade however just defines a simpler interface to a module or system but doesn't add any additional functionality. Other modules in the system aren't directly aware of the concept of a facade and could be considered unidirectional.

## The Prototype Pattern
The GoF refer to the prototype pattern as one which creates objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning.

We can think of the prototype pattern as being based on prototypal inheritance where we create objects which act as prototypes for other objects. The prototype object itself is effectively used as a blueprint for each object the constructor creates. If the prototype of the constructor function used contains a property called name for example (as per the code sample lower down), then each object created by that same constructor will also have this same property.

```js
var vehicle = {
  getModel: function () {
    console.log( "The model of this vehicle is.." + this.model );
  }
};
 
var car = Object.create(vehicle, {
  "id": {
    value: MY_GLOBAL.nextId(),
    // writable:false, configurable:false by default
    enumerable: true
  },
  "model": {
    value: "Ford",
    enumerable: true
  }
});
```

## The Command Pattern, [ref](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#commandpatternjavascript)
The Command pattern aims to encapsulate method invocation, requests or operations into a single object and gives us the ability to both parameterize and pass method calls around that can be executed at our discretion. In addition, it enables us to decouple objects invoking the action from the objects which implement them, giving us a greater degree of overall flexibility in swapping out concrete classes (objects).


## The Facade Pattern
When we put up a facade, we present an outward appearance to the world which may conceal a very different reality. This was the inspiration for the name behind the next pattern we're going to review - the Facade pattern. This pattern provides a convenient higher-level interface to a larger body of code, hiding its true underlying complexity. Think of it as simplifying the API being presented to other developers, something which almost always improves usability.
```js
var addMyEvent = function( el,ev,fn ){
   if( el.addEventListener ){
            el.addEventListener( ev,fn, false );
      }else if(el.attachEvent){
            el.attachEvent( "on" + ev, fn );
      } else{
           el["on" + ev] = fn;
    }
};
```

## The Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern is another creational pattern concerned with the notion of creating objects. Where it differs from the other patterns in its category is that it doesn't explicitly require us use a constructor. Instead, a Factory can provide a generic interface for creating objects, where we can specify the type of factory object we wish to be created.

## The Mixin Pattern
#### Sub-classing
```js
// a new instance of Person can then easily be created as follows:
var clark = new Person( "Clark", "Kent" );
 
// Define a subclass constructor for for "Superhero":
var Superhero = function( firstName, lastName, powers ){
 
    // Invoke the superclass constructor on the new object
    // then use .call() to invoke the constructor as a method of
    // the object to be initialized.
 
    Person.call( this, firstName, lastName );
 
    // Finally, store their powers, a new array of traits not found in a normal "Person"
    this.powers = powers;
};
 
Superhero.prototype = Object.create( Person.prototype );
var superman = new Superhero( "Clark", "Kent", ["flight","heat-vision"] );
console.log( superman );
 
// Outputs Person attributes as well as powers
```
#### Mixins
```js
// Extend both constructors with our Mixin
_.extend( CarAnimator.prototype, myMixins );
_.extend( PersonAnimator.prototype, myMixins );
```

## The Decorator Pattern
Classically, Decorators offered the ability to add behaviour to existing classes in a system dynamically. The idea was that the decoration itself wasn't essential to the base functionality of the class, otherwise it would be baked into the superclass itself.

They can be used to modify existing systems where we wish to add additional features to objects without the need to heavily modify the underlying code using them. A common reason why developers use them is their applications may contain features requiring a large quantity of distinct types of object. 
```js
// A vehicle constructor
function Vehicle( vehicleType ){
    // some sane defaults
    this.vehicleType = vehicleType || "car";
    this.model = "default";
    this.license = "00000-000";
}

// Lets create a new instance of vehicle, to be decorated
var truck = new Vehicle( "truck" );
 
// New functionality we're decorating vehicle with
truck.setModel = function( modelName ){
    this.model = modelName;
};
 
truck.setColor = function( color ){
    this.color = color;
};
```

## JavaScript MV* Patterns


### MVC
MVC is an architectural design pattern that encourages improved application organization through a separation of concerns. It enforces the isolation of business data (Models) from user interfaces (Views), with a third component (Controllers) traditionally managing logic and user-input.

#### Models
Models manage the data for an application. They are concerned with neither the user-interface nor presentation layers but instead represent unique forms of data that an application may require. When a model changes (e.g when it is updated), it will typically notify its observers (e.g views, a concept we will cover shortly) that a change has occurred so that they may react accordingly.

#### Views
Views are a visual representation of models that present a filtered view of their current state. A view typically observes a model and is notified when the model changes, allowing the view to update itself accordingly. Design pattern literature commonly refers to views as "dumb" given that their knowledge of models and controllers in an application is limited.

#### Controllers
Controllers are an intermediary between models and views which are classically responsible for updating the model when the user manipulates the view.

#### MVP
Model-view-presenter (MVP) is a derivative of the MVC design pattern which focuses on improving presentation logic.

The P in MVP stands for presenter. It's a component which contains the user-interface business logic for the view. Unlike MVC, invocations from the view are delegated to the presenter, which are decoupled from the view and instead talk to it through an interface. This allows for all kinds of useful things such as being able to mock views in unit tests.

#### MVVM
MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern based on MVC and MVP, which attempts to more clearly separate the development of user-interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behavior in an application. To this end, many implementations of this pattern make use of declarative data bindings to allow a separation of work on Views from other layers.

The ViewModel can be considered a specialized Controller that acts as a data converter. It changes Model information into View information, passing commands from the View to the Model.

## Modern Modular JavaScript Design Patterns
### AMD
The overall goal for the AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) format is to provide a solution for modular JavaScript that developers can use today. The AMD module format itself is a proposal for defining modules where both the module and dependencies can be asynchronously loaded.

##### Loading AMD Modules Using RequireJS
```js
require(["app/myModule"],
    function( myModule ){
        // start the main module which in-turn
        // loads other modules
        var module = new myModule();
        module.doStuff();
});
```
### CommonJS
A Module Format Optimized For The Server. The CommonJS module proposal specifies a simple API for declaring modules server-side and unlike AMD attempts to cover a broader set of concerns such as io, file-system, promises and more.

```js
// package/lib is a dependency we require
var lib = require( "package/lib" );
 
// behaviour for our module
function foo(){
    lib.log( "hello world!" );
}
 
// export (expose) foo to other modules
exports.foo = foo;
```
##### AMD-equivalent Of The First CommonJS Example
```js
define(function(require){
   var lib = require( "package/lib" );
 
    // some behaviour for our module
    function foo(){
        lib.log( "hello world!" );
    }
 
    // export (expose) foo for other modules
    return {
        foobar: foo
    };
});
```

### UMD
For developers wishing to create modules that can work in both browser and server-side environments, existing solutions could be considered little lacking. To help alleviate this, James Burke, I and a number of other developers created UMD (Universal Module Definition) https://github.com/umdjs/umd.
